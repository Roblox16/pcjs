Thanks to the generosity of PCjs user Phil Mayes, who recently donated *boxes* of old PC diskettes for the price of shipping,
the [PCjs Software Archive](/software/pcjs/) continues to slowly grow.

Among the boxes of treasures:

  - [Microsoft C Compiler 1.03 (Beta)](/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/c/1.03/)
  - [Microsoft C Compiler 1.04](/software/pcx86/lang/microsoft/c/1.04/)
  - [Microsoft Word 1.10 (for DOS)](/software/pcx86/app/microsoft/word/1.10/)
  - [The Norton Utilities 2.00](/software/pcx86/util/norton/2.00/)

There are a *lot* more disks to examine and duplicate, and the heads of my poor 5.25-inch disk drive seem to need increasingly
frequent cleaning these days.  But progress is being made.

Thanks Phil!

And if *you* happen to have any boxes of old PC diskettes that you'd be willing to donate, feel free to [contact me](mailto:Jeff@pcjs.org)
with pictures, and if it appears there are any unique or historically interesting disks in your collection, I'll be happy to pay for
shipping *and* publicly acknowledge your generous contribution.
